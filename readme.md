# Simple Express Server

This is a simple Express server for developing websites using Gulp, Bower & Jade.

Took reference from here:

[A SIMPLE WEBSITE IN NODE.JS WITH EXPRESS, JADE AND STYLUS] (http://www.clock.co.uk/blog/a-simple-website-in-nodejs-with-express-jade-and-stylus)
[Getting started with gulp] (http://markgoodyear.com/2014/01/getting-started-with-gulp/)

I made some modifications to the Gulp config that Mark propose due to the new version in some of the packages used.

In the near future will implement some test framework to this.

All the Bower dependencies will be in public/lib.

I use [nodemon] (http://nodemon.io/) to start the server and [Gulp] (http://gulpjs.com/) to listen for the changes on the frontend.
